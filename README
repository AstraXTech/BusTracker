# BusTracker
A browser based tool that allows users to track MBTA vehicle locations on a map with a newly updated location posted every 15 seconds.

Users can see the locations of the MBTA vehivle fleet by real-time updated color markers on the map.

In the future, I hope to expand the viewable vehicles or add departure / arrival location & time filters.
